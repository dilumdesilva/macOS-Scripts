# AirPods Connect Application

This is an application which was developed to automate the steps of manually paring a AirPods to a MacBook or any device/laptop whihch runs macOS x or higher versions. Furthermore, we can customize the same script to pair any bluetooth device without going through the bluetooth device list manually.


## How to develop your own AirPod connect app

1. Open your spotlight search by pressing on command key and space bar then search for **Script Editor**.

2. Once you click on the **Script Editor** it will open a blank window as I have shown below.

3. Copy the script that I have provided in the [script.txt file](https://github.com/dilum1995/macOS-Scripts/blob/master/AirPods_connect_app/script.txt)

4. Change the **Dilum’s AirPods** to your AirPod's device name (you can take this from your bluetooth device list).

## Let's put nice app icon for our AirPod connect app

I have uploaded the icon that I used as [my app icon](https://github.com/dilum1995/macOS-Scripts/blob/master/AirPods_connect_app/src/AirPodsIcon.icns). Feel free to customize it or use your own icon which is in **icns** format.

In order to change your app icon please follow the steps below.

1. Navigate to your applications folder using the finder window and select the application which you developed and saved there.

2. Right click on the application and select **Get Info** from the menu as shown below.
